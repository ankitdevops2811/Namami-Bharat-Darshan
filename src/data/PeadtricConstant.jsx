    PaediatricOccupational : `Our paediatric occupational therapists assist children in
    performing “occupations” with the greatest level of independence
    possible. Childhood occupations include learning in school and
    playing with friends. Mission Walk provide paediatric
    occupational therapy for children of all ages to help them
    achieve their full potential. Our highly experienced and
    dedicated paediatric occupational therapists take a
    developmental approach to address areas of physical ability
    (fine and gross motor skills), sensory processing and
    modulation, handwriting skills, visual motor skills, and
    self-help skills. We use a wide range of therapeutic equipment
    and techniques to best help your child achieve his or her goals.
    Parents are also encouraged to participate in therapy sessions
    as they are an integral part of the child’s treatment.`,

    physiotherapy using the NeuroSuit and Multifunctional Therapy
    Units.At Mission Walk Centre, our highly trained pediatric
    physiotherapists challenge the child in a loving environment,
    pushing their performance and helping them achieve new
    developmental milestones. All of our therapists –physical,
    speech, and occupational—work with each other and with family
    members to assess each child’s current functioning level. Then
    they create an individualised plan to help each child achieve
    optimal results. We offer pediatric physiotherapy in both weekly
    and intensive settings.`,

    techniques to address oral motor dysfunction, apraxia, fluency,
    receptive and expressive language, social pragmatics, and
    feeding and swallowing difficulties, to help your child improve
    overall communication and/or feeding development.We provide
    individualized speech therapy for kids with complex
    communication needs. Our speech language pathologists are
    experienced with a variety of Augmentative and Alternative
    Communication (AAC) devices while keeping a child’s individual
    strengths, difficulties, language skills, positioning, vision,
    and motor skills in mind. Speech therapists approach any
    alternative augmentative communication system with assuming
    absolute child competence and ability.`,

    test bed for translating 21st-century biology and new measures
