                There are a select few people in the world who aim for respect
                over riches. For these empowered individuals, what matters most
                is giving back to society. Dr Ravi Badavath, the founder of
                Mission Walk, has a similar story to tell. In a fiercely
                competitive world, where anyone with ‘lesser qualities’ than the
                best cannot be expected to survive, society tends to look down
                upon those suffering from disabilities. Faced with a lack of
                proper care and treatment, such individuals are subjected to
                unwanted neglect. In such times, Mission Walk strives toward its
                goal of enabling neurologically injured patients to walk again
                and live shoulder-to-shoulder with the others.
              </p>
              <strong>
                <h4>The Man Behind the Mission</h4>
              </strong>
              <p className="mb-4  wow fadeInUp" style={{ fontSize: "20px" }}>
                Dr Ravi Badavath was quick to realize how the infrastructural
                aspects for neuro patients in the country were lacking dismally.
                Besides, physiotherapists were offered only limited training in
                the aspect along with lack of data-based research in the field.
                These factors had contributed to stagnancy in any further
                progress in the domain of neuro patient care as well as any
                improvements in their day-to-day living conditions. Instead of
                deterring him, however, these situations motivated Dr Ravi
                Badavath to lead from the front. It was 2016 when he embarked on
                establishing a rehabilitation facility in Hyderabad to provide
                world-class rehabilitation facilities for neuro patients in
                India.
              </p>
              <strong>
                <h4>The Journey</h4>
              </strong>
              <p className="mb-4  wow fadeInUp" style={{ fontSize: "20px" }}>
                The beginning of the journey was the most difficult phase of
                all. Dr Ravi tried to make ends meet by tending to at least 15
                patients every day. However, he was well aware of the fact that
                each patient requires special attention when it comes to
                neurological concerns. Even the timeline of recovery is fragile
                and long. This called for more than just individual assistance.
                It was then that Dr Ravi decided to establish an organization
                that could cater to different rehabilitation needs of patients
                with passion and utmost care. This organization would be able to
                realize his dream of serving each patient with special emphasis
                as well as providing them with affordable facilities for
                long-term treatment, thus penetrating wider sections of society
                and not just the privileged. After all these years of immense
                hard work and constant effort, Mission Walk has earned the
                repute of being an expert in the field of physiotherapy and
                rehabilitation. Under its wide umbrella, it caters to the
                treatment of patients ailing with different conditions such as
                spinal cord injuries and other problems, brain injuries, stroke
                and so on. Besides, it also makes sure that its services reach
                patients of all age groups.
              </p>

              <strong>
                <h4>Striving for Brilliance</h4>
              </strong>

                style={{ fontSize: "20px", textAlign: "justify" }}
              >
                The organization has ensured that it identifies talented
                professionals from across the country for its services. Mission
                Walk has recruited some of the best physiotherapists from
                different corners of the country. The diversity and magnanimity
                the organization strives to seem more evident from the fact that
                it has therapists from almost every state of the country.
                Mission Walk has come to be associated with the treatment of
                nearly 1000 patients so far, varying in the underlying
                conditions they were faced with. The repute of the
                organization’s talented professionals as well as its world-class
                services soon spread far and wide. Mission Walk has been seeing
                patients from all over the world in recent times. It owns the
                credit for having treated patients from across India, the Middle
                East, Africa and South-East Asia.
              </p>

                So far, Mission Walk has been able to emerge as an exemplar
                organization in the healthcare industry. It has witnessed
                extreme satisfaction among its patients, thanks to its expertise

                procedures and assessments. Besides, the organization boasts of
                a wide array of high-end and low-end equipment, powered by the
                passion and hard work of its motivated staff. All this has made
                Mission Walk reach the topmost ranks when it comes to
                therapeutic destinations in this part of the world. Mission Walk
                and its founder Dr Ravi Badavath aim to be the best in the world
