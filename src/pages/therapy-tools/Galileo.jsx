                    Mission Walk uses the Galileo plate which provides a side
                    alternating motion based on the natural movement of human
                    gait, creating a tilting movement of the pelvis.

                    Whole Body Vibration (WBV) is delivered via a mechanical
                    vibrating platform. As the machine vibrates, it transmits
                    energy to the individual standing, sitting, lying or
                    kneeling on the plate causing the muscles to contract and
                    relax many times each second.

                  Mission Walk uses the Galileo plate which provides a side
                    alternating motion based on the natural movement of human
                    gait, creating a tilting movement of the pelvis. With
                    frequencies ranging from 5 â€“ 30 Hz depending upon the
                    platform, therapists are able to use the Galileo to address
                    a variety of therapeutic goals including balance training,
                    mobilization and stretching of tight muscles, spasticity
                    reduction, and strength and coordination building,

                    Unique to Galileo WBV platform is the Wobbel function which
                    generates randomly changing frequencies during the training.
                    The variability in frequencies provided by the Wobbel
                    function ensures that the patient gains the most out of
                    their training time by disallowing the muscles to
                    accommodate to the stimulation, forcing the body to
                    constantly adapt to the changing frequencies.

                  Mission Walk utilizes WBV training in all aspects of its therapy
                    programs and your child may participate in Galileo training
                    in any of their PT, OT, and ST hours.
