                The Robert R. McCormick Think + Speak Lab is designed for those
                recovering the ability to think, reason, perceive, swallow, eat,
                talk, interact with others and make decisions — all of which are
                key for returning to everyday life. In this Lab, combined
                therapeutic care and scientific application help patients
                recover these building blocks of ability.
